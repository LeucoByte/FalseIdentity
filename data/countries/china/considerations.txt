## Cultural Considerations for China

### Greetings and Social Etiquette
- Greetings involve a slight nod or bow rather than handshakes (especially with elders)
- Address people with their title + surname (e.g., "Manager Wang", "Teacher Li")
- The concept of "face" (mianzi/面子) is crucial - avoid causing embarrassment in public
- Gift-giving follows specific rules: avoid clocks, white/black wrapping, sharp objects
- Number symbolism: 8 is lucky (prosperity), 4 is unlucky (sounds like "death")

### Family and Hierarchy
- Filial piety (xiao/孝) remains deeply important across generations
- Respect for elders is fundamental - children expected to care for aging parents
- Family name comes first, given name second
- One-child policy (1979-2015) created generation of only children ("little emperors")
- Extended family ties remain strong despite urbanization

### Food Culture
- Meals are social events, often shared family-style with rotating lazy Susan
- Rice or noodles form the base of most meals, complemented by multiple dishes
- Tea culture is ancient and ceremonial - offering tea shows respect
- Regional cuisines vary dramatically (Sichuan spicy, Cantonese mild, etc.)
- Street food culture thrives in cities - breakfast vendors, night markets

### Work and Education
- Education highly valued - intense competition for university entrance (gaokao/高考)
- "996" work culture common in tech (9am-9pm, 6 days/week) but increasingly criticized
- Guanxi (关系/relationships) networks crucial for business and opportunities
- Company loyalty less emphasized among younger generations
- Side hustles common, especially in gig economy

### Religion and Philosophy
- Most Chinese are non-religious but practice folk traditions
- Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism blend into everyday life
- Ancestor worship and tomb-sweeping (Qingming Festival) widely practiced
- Lunar New Year (Spring Festival) is the most important holiday
- Traditional beliefs coexist with modern secular lifestyle

### Housing and Urban Life
- High-rise apartment living dominates urban areas
- Property ownership seen as prerequisite for marriage
- Hukou (户口) household registration system affects access to services
- Urban-rural divide significant - many migrate from villages to cities for work
- Public parks are social hubs - tai chi, dancing, chess, kite-flying

### Technology and Modern Life
- Mobile payment (WeChat Pay, Alipay) near-universal in cities
- Social media ecosystem separate from West (WeChat, Weibo, Douyin/TikTok)
- High-speed rail network connects major cities efficiently
- E-commerce highly developed - same-day delivery common
- Younger generation tech-savvy, embraces online culture

### Regional Differences
- North-South cultural divide: wheat vs rice, dumplings vs noodles
- Coastal cities more internationally exposed than inland areas
- Dialect diversity extreme - Mandarin is common language but not native to all
- Ethnic minorities in border regions (Xinjiang, Tibet, Yunnan) have distinct cultures
- Tier-1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen) vs smaller cities show lifestyle gaps

### Health and Medicine
- Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practiced alongside Western medicine
- Herbal remedies, acupuncture, cupping commonly used
- Concept of "hot" and "cold" foods affects dietary choices
- Emphasis on prevention through balanced diet and exercise
- Public health campaigns (anti-smoking, exercise) increasingly prominent

### Marriage and Relationships
- Parental approval traditionally important, though changing among youth
- Bride price (彩礼) and dowry negotiations still common, especially rural areas
- Rising age of marriage - many delay due to career, education, housing costs
- Gender imbalance from one-child policy creates "leftover women" social pressure
- Divorce rates rising, especially in urban areas
